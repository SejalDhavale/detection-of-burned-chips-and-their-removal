To detect burned chips light sensor are used.Light dependent resistors ( LDR ) are used to detect the burned chips.Blowers are used to throw away the burned chips from the conveyor whenever burned chips detected.Blowers are used to throw away burned chips from the conveyor.Here I have used two blowers, number of blowers depend on the size of the conveyor.Time measurement is necessary for blower cycle.Here I measure time taken by chips to reach from light source to blower.
